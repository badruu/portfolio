    <h2><em>ABOUT ME</em></h2>
      <p>
        I'm B. <strong>Noor</strong>. Perhaps you know why my first name is shortened. If you don't know, don't worry about it. I'm not going to reveal it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my primary and secondary education, I schooled in Nairobi. In my life, I've never joined a boarding school.
        If you are one those diehard supporters of how boarding life is great, by now you must be curious. But hey, do you know that I used to work part-time from form2. Now, compare the ton of experience I have gained with your lame boarding life experience.
        Ouch! I'm not rude. I am just joking! Messing with letters to finish my independent project. Nothing personal here.

    <h3>MY HOBBY</h3>
        <p>
          Playing with numbers is my hobby. Drafting balancesheets, statements, balancing books of accounts. Also, it is my hobby to help algebra find x and y whenever it fails to do so and asks for my help in algebraic expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also decided to take programming classes recently. Although I was curious about the field at first, and was not quite sure why I was joining Moringa, I'm loving it even more than KFC drumsticks.
